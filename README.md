ZendMuscleApplication
=====================

Introduction
------------
This is a more enhanced, muscular version of the ZF2 skeleton application.
It demonstrates the usage of basic components such as Zend\Authentication
and Zend\Cache.

This application is meant to demonstrate the various components in ZF2 
in a way that can be seen in action from start to finish.
